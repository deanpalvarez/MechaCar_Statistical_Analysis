# Using R/dyplyr for Statistical Analysis on Vehicle Data

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Below is the summary output from our dataset:

```

Given how our p value is 5.35e-11 (0.0000000000535) which is very close to zero, it's fair to say we can reject a null hypothesis, and that our data is statistically significant. This means our intercepts are directly affected by mpg, so further analysis can be conducted.
